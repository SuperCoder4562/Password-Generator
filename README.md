# Password-Generator
This is for a Javascript Course that I am doing and this is one of the projects that I have to do. Hope you enjoy!!!

How to Use Password Generator:

1. Open the website (Link: https://supercoder4562.github.io/Password-Generator/)
2. Inspect the website
3. Open the console

And there you have your password. If you want a different password, just reload the website and follow the steps again!
